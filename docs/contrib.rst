Code
====

If you would like to contribute to PyDSE, fork the `main repository
<https://github.com/blue-yonder/pydse/>`_ on GitHub, then submit a
“pull request” (PR):

#. `Create an account <https://github.com/signup/free>`_ on GitHub if you do
   not already have one.
#. Fork the project repository: click on the *Fork* button near the top of the
   page. This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server.
#. Clone this copy to your local disk::

    git clone git@github.com:YourLogin/pydse.git

#. Create a branch to hold your changes::

    git checkout -b my-feature

   and start making changes. Never work in the master branch!

#. Work on this copy, on your computer, using `Git <http://git-scm.com/>`_ to
   do the version control. When you’re done editing, do::

    git add modified_files
    git commit

   to record your changes in Git, then push them to GitHub with::

    git push -u origin my-feature
